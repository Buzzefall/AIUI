# Transformation Execution Log

This log tracks the key decisions and actions taken during the transformation of the project to the v2.0 architecture.

### **2025-08-13**

**Decision: Adjusted v2.0 Transformation Plan**

*   **Action:** The `Transformation Path v2.0.md` was updated to reflect a new, pragmatic approach.
*   **Summary:** We will prioritize a seamless transition of existing functionality. The plan is now:
    1.  Implement Phase 1 (Backend) & Phase 2 (Canvas UI).
    2.  Stub out Phase 3 (Agentic Core) to provide the necessary interfaces without full implementation.
    3.  Integrate the new UI with the backend, preserving existing chat functionality via the stubs.
    4.  Defer non-essential features like real-time collaboration to a post-v2.0 phase.
*   **Rationale:** This approach ensures the application remains functional and stable while undergoing a major architectural overhaul, delivering value faster.
*   **Reference:** `Transformation Path v2.0.md`

### **2025-08-13**

**Decision: Backend Technology Stack for v2.0**

*   **Action:** Selected the core technologies for the new backend service.
*   **Summary:**
    *   **Framework:** Python with FastAPI
    *   **Database:** MongoDB
    *   **API Style:** REST
    *   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   **Rationale:** This stack was chosen for its synergy with AI/ML ecosystems (Python), schema flexibility (MongoDB), simplicity and extensibility (REST), and stateless security (JWT), aligning with the project's long-term goals and the immediate need for a minimally viable implementation.

### **2025-08-13**

**Action: Scaffolding the Python Backend**

*   **Summary:** Created the initial directory structure and dependency file for the new FastAPI backend.
    *   A `backend` directory was established to house the Python code.
    *   A `backend/requirements.txt` file was created with the core dependencies.
    *   An `backend/app` directory was created with a `main.py` to hold the application logic.
*   **Rationale:** This establishes a clean separation between the frontend and backend code and provides a reproducible environment and structure for the new service.

### **2025-08-13**

**Action: Containerized Development Database**

*   **Summary:** Created a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root to define a MongoDB service.
*   **Rationale:** Using Docker Compose for the database makes the development environment reproducible and independent of local machine configurations. It simplifies setup for any developer and aligns with modern deployment practices.

---

### **2025-08-14**

**Decision: Python Import Strategy**

*   **Action:** Decided to use absolute imports (e.g., `from app.config import settings`) over relative imports.
*   **Rationale:** Absolute imports enhance code clarity, readability, and maintainability, which is crucial for the long-term health of the project. This aligns with PEP 8 recommendations and makes the codebase easier to navigate and refactor.

### **2025-08-14**

**Action: Backend Configuration Management**

*   **Summary:** Established a robust configuration management system for the backend service.
    *   Created a typed, structured configuration file at `backend/app/config.py` using Pydantic settings for clear, validated settings.
    *   Added a `backend/Dockerfile` to define the container for the Python application.
    *   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the new backend service alongside the database.
    *   Created a `backend/.env.example` file to document required environment variables.
    *   Integrated the configuration into the main application file, `backend/app/main.py`.
*   **Rationale:** This setup provides a secure, flexible, and scalable way to manage application settings. It separates configuration from code, which is a critical best practice, and fully containerizes the backend for a consistent development and production environment.

### **2025-08-14**

**Action: Implemented Project Persistence (Phase 1.2)**

*   **Summary:** Developed the core functionality for managing "Projects" in the backend.
    *   Established a database connection module in `backend/app/database.py`.
    *   Defined Pydantic models for `Project`, `ProjectCreate`, and `ProjectUpdate` in `backend/app/models.py`.
    *   Created a dedicated router in `backend/app/routers/projects.py` with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for projects.
    *   Integrated the new projects router into the main FastAPI application.
*   **Rationale:** This completes the second step of Phase 1, providing the foundational API for the application's core data entity.

### **2025-08-14**

**Action: Implemented User Sessions (Phase 1.3)**

*   **Summary:** Introduced user authentication and session management.
    *   Added `User` and `Token` models to `backend/app/models.py`.
    *   Created a `backend/app/security.py` module for handling password hashing and JWT creation/decoding.
    *   Implemented an authentication router in `backend/app/routers/auth.py` with endpoints for user creation and token generation (login).
    *   Secured all project-related endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and manage their own projects.
*   **Rationale:** This completes Phase 1 of the transformation. It establishes a secure backend with clear ownership of resources, which is a prerequisite for all future development.

### **2025-08-14**

**Decision: Refactored Security Module**

*   **Action:** Refactored the `security.py` module and the `auth.py` router to improve separation of concerns.
*   **Summary:**
    *   The `security.py` module was stripped of its dependencies on the database and web framework. It is now a pure, self-contained module for cryptographic operations.
    *   The `get_current_user` dependency, which requires database access, was moved into the `auth.py` router, its logical home.
*   **Rationale:** This change improves the design of the application by adhering to the principle of separation of concerns, making the code more modular, maintainable, and secure.

---

### **2025-08-14**

**Action: Created Distilled PEP 8 Guide**

*   **Summary:** Created a comprehensive, distilled guide to PEP 8, located at `specifications/PEP8_Distilled.md`. The guide was refined to include direct, in-context references to other relevant PEPs and a detailed appendix justifying each reference.
*   **Rationale:** This provides a quick and accurate reference for maintaining a high standard of code quality and consistency throughout the project.
