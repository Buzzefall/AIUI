**Feature: Chat Message Editing & Deletion**

*   **Action:** Implemented the foundational logic for selecting and deleting message pairs from the chat history.
*   **Summary:**
    1.  **Data Model Refactoring:** The `Message` interface in `src/state/chatSlice.ts` was updated to include a `responseTo: string | null` property. This creates an explicit, robust, data-driven link between a user's prompt and the model's response, replacing a fragile index-based approach.
    2.  **State Management:** New reducers (`toggleMessageSelection`, `deleteSelectedMessages`) were added to `chatSlice.ts` to manage the selection state and handle the deletion of message pairs based on the new `responseTo` link.
    3.  **Component Integration:** The `ChatMessage.tsx` component was updated to handle `onClick` and `onContextMenu` events, dispatching the new Redux actions.
    4.  **Styling:** A new CSS module, `ChatMessage.module.css`, was created to provide a visual selection highlight, adhering to the project's convention of component-scoped styles.
*   **Rationale:** This establishes the core data model and state management foundation for all message editing features. The data-driven approach is significantly more robust and maintainable than relying on implicit array order.

**Action: Implemented Context Menu for Messages**

*   **Summary:**
    1.  A generic, reusable `ContextMenu.tsx` component and an associated `useContextMenu` hook were identified and leveraged.
    2.  A new `MessageContextMenu.tsx` component was created to render the menu with conditional logic. Initially, it displays "Delete" or "Delete Selected" based on the current selection state.
    3.  The context menu was integrated into `ChatMessage.tsx`, appearing on right-click.
    4.  A bug was fixed in `ContextMenu.tsx` where right-clicking the backdrop would re-trigger the menu. The fix involved stopping event propagation.
    5.  Localization support was added for the new menu items in `en.json` and `ru.json`.
*   **Rationale:** This provides the primary user interface for accessing message-specific actions in a clean, conventional manner.

**Action: Implemented Deletion Confirmation**

*   **Summary:**
    1.  A generic `ConfirmationDialog.tsx` component was created to handle user confirmation for destructive actions.
    2.  The `MessageContextMenu.tsx` was updated to use this dialog. The "Delete" menu item now opens the confirmation dialog instead of deleting directly.
    3.  The actual deletion logic is now executed only after the user confirms the action in the dialog.
*   **Rationale:** This adds a critical safety layer, preventing users from accidentally deleting parts of their conversation history.

**Action: Implemented Robust Data Migration**

*   **Summary:**
    1.  The `loadStateFromLocalStorage` function in `src/state/chatSlice.ts` was refactored to include a comprehensive, multi-stage migration path.
    2.  The migration correctly handles two legacy data formats:
        *   An old format where messages were raw `Content` objects.
        *   A malformed format created by a previous, faulty migration, where `Message` objects were missing the `content` wrapper.
    3.  The final, robust migration logic was implemented to ensure all legacy data is correctly and safely transformed into the current `Message` structure.
    4.  After verification, the temporary migration code was removed to finalize the implementation, leaving the loader clean.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures full backward compatibility for all users, preventing application failures due to outdated or malformed data in their browser's local storage. It was a critical step to ensure a smooth user experience after the data model was updated.
