- To finish implementation of Import / Export feature: The `ExportPanel.tsx` component has a toggle for import/export mode and commented-out import logic. The Redux slices (`chatSlice`, `settingsSlice`, `localeSlice`) have corresponding `set` actions, but these are not yet dispatched from the `ExportPanel`.
- To make API errors part of the message list, so that they were not misplaced upon conversation change: Currently, API errors are stored as a single `error` field in `chatSlice` and displayed in `ResponsePanel`. This error is not tied to a specific conversation message and may be lost or become irrelevant when switching conversations. Errors should be integrated as a message within the `messages` array of the relevant `Conversation` object.
- To fix UI refresh upon failure: files must not vanish and form must not reset: The `PromptingPanel` manages `prompt` and `selectedFiles` using `useState`. There is no explicit logic to clear these states on API call failure, suggesting they should persist. Verification is needed to confirm if they are indeed vanishing or resetting under error conditions, which might indicate an unhandled component lifecycle issue.
- Add a button to switch from model flash to pro: This feature is not currently implemented. It will require adding a new state for model selection (e.g., in `settingsSlice`), a UI element (button/toggle) in an appropriate panel (e.g., `ControlPanel` or a new `ModelSelectionPanel`), and logic to update the model used in `geminiApiClient` based on the selected option.
